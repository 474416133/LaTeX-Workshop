## Prerequisites for building the extension

Make sure you have installed:

- [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/)
- `npm`
- the [`tslint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) extension for VS Code (recommended)

Then run

    npm install

inside the extension workspace to download the node modules needed to build the extension.

## Testing the extension

In VS Code, simply press `<F5>` (or run `Debug: Start Debugging` from the command palette) and a new window will pop up where you can test the extension.
